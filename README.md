# Hello World
Hi, I'm Kevin! And today I will show you how to run this incredible application developed by me. 

# Technology
As development technology, I used Angular 6, HTML, CSS and TypeScript.

# How run the project in your machine?
I'll go through a brief step-by-step guide on how to run the project on your machine!

# 1ª Step
Unzip the project folder on your machine. 

# 2º Step
Open the project in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your choice.

# 3º Step
Run the command `npm install`, and go get a coffee, this might take a while hehe.

# 4º Step
Now let's run the application! Just run the `ng serve` command, and wait a few moments.

# 5º Step
That's it, the project is running on your machine! Just open the generated local link, normally it is `http://localhost:4200/`

# Final Considerations
I created a folder architecture, which I felt comfortable with, both to facilitate the development of this test and to show how I organize myself in day-to-day projects. It had been a while since I worked with animations by hand, so it was very nostalgic to remember what it felt like.

I hope you like how the project turned out, I look forward to hearing from you!

# TesteFrontAnotaAi
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
